	<p>For my final project I wanted to go into an animation direction. I was inspired by the idea of newspaper clippings and how seeing multiple titles like the one’s from the recent Amanda Knox documentary on Netflix really summarized even the bias those papers were written in and how connotation is so important in word choice of headers and titles. My video is a montage of headers and headshots of my character and other unknown characters like they are fugitives the world should be hunting for. I stuck to Adobe Photoshop to make my own newspaper headers and Adobe AfterEffects to set in motion as a small thirty second montage. I mostly used the camera function in AfterEffects to really get the smooth transition I was looking for. I also used the spot light effect that allowed me to let the view focus on a specific part of the newspaper itself. Finally, I faded and blurred the layers into each other as if the camera is traveling through the paper. I didn’t stray too far from my storyboard. I mostly simplified the idea so I could produce something that I was happy with and not get too caught up in the effects.</p>
